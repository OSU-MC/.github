# Open-Source Classroom Polling Software
This project will develop a free, open-source, classroom polling website. Once developed, the project will be used in OSU classrooms and shared with instructors around the world. This project will include front end and back end web development, a Canvas / LMS interface, and responsive user interface development for live polling and advanced question formats on desktop, mobile, and other devices. Stretch goals include an intelligent grouping algorithm to pair students based on answers, tracking of students to give feedback to instructors, and an in-class social network for just-in-time Learning Assistant interventions.

## Objectives
Website interface, student/teacher login, and tracking of student grades, class questions, course lectures Live polling interface Bi-directional Canvas communication Intelligent grouping algorithm (stretch) Instructor feedback interface (stretch) In-class social network (stretch)

## Motivations
Currently, the only non-tuition cost for students in the Physics 20x sequence at OSU is an old, but necessary polling software. There are free alternatives available, but none feature intelligent grouping, and most are limited in question types. This project will provide a free option for teachers around the world, as well as an open-source starting point for developing more features. This project will save OSU students more than $6000 each year. It will also provide a more flexible, fully featured and integrated software.
